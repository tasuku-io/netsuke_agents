# LuaExecutor Audit Summary

This document summarizes the final analysis and audit of the `NetsukeAgents.LuaExecutor` module and its corresponding test suite. It serves as a guide for future enhancements, hardening, and maintenance.

## ✅ Test Suite Review Summary

### ✅ Coverage Strengths

* **Basic execution**: Normal cases, context merging, return validation.
* **Security validation**: Regex-based static checks against direct and obfuscated attack vectors.
* **Data marshaling**: Covers deeply nested maps, lists, nils, atoms, and primitive types.
* **Resource enforcement**: Infinite loops, large tables, memory-intensive operations.
* **Runtime safety**: Handles syntax/runtime errors, invalid return values, unexpected shapes.
* **Global sandbox isolation**: Ensures `_G`, metatables, raw access, and globals are blocked.
* **Concurrency**: Uses `Task.async` to validate that global state and memory are isolated.
* **Cycle detection**: Handles cyclic and mutually referencing Lua tables.

### ⚠️ Suggested Enhancements

* **Print capture**: If `print()` is redirected or hooked, test `ExUnit.CaptureLog` output.
* **Property-based testing**: Use `StreamData` to generate nested structures or randomized Lua.
* **Strict return validation**: Optionally fail when `run()` does not return a table.
* **Timeout task kill check**: Consider asserting task shutdown on timeout (using `receive {:DOWN, ...}`).

## ✅ LuaExecutor Module Review Summary

### ✅ Strengths

* **Robust sandbox**: Uses both static validation and runtime sanitization of Lua global state.
* **Timeout + memory control**: Enforced via `Task.yield/2` and `Process.info(self(), :memory)`.
* **Lua ↔ Elixir conversion**: Safely serializes data across runtime boundaries.
* **Deep table extraction**: Uses `next()` recursion and proper introspection of Lua refs.
* **Error isolation**: Catching exceptions (`try/rescue/catch`) ensures BEAM stability.

### ⚠️ Observations and Future Improvements

| Area                      | Recommendation                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regex validation**      | Consider moving to allowlist parsing in future to replace blacklist approach.                |
| **Lua key serialization** | Sanitize keys like `"foo="` that can break Lua syntax. Use `["key"] = ...` format.           |
| **Memory check scope**    | Currently checks `self()`. For better control, monitor `task.pid`.                           |
| **ToolRegistry**          | Implementation is stubbed. Ensure future tools are namespaced (`tools.print`) and immutable. |
| **Error wrapping**        | Clean up some mixed `{:error, reason}` patterns for clarity and consistency.                 |

## ✅ Long-Term Hardening Ideas

* Add `max_depth` for Lua table conversion to avoid stack overflows.
* Hook `print()` or `io.write()` to Elixir logger with redirection.
* Consider per-instruction Lua execution metering (if Luerl evolves).
* Cache precompiled sandbox state to avoid redundant `:luerl.init()`.
* Integrate `Benchee` or `ExCoveralls` for performance/coverage metrics.

---

**Final Verdict**: Production-quality sandbox with impressive security, correctness, and test rigor.

Future work can focus on stricter metering, tool registration, and evolving Lua obfuscation resistance.
